      <h2 >Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        As a group of AUB students, we understand the struggle of finding the
        right courses that guarantee both enjoyment and an enriching learning
        experience. After countless hours of reaching out to seniors, checking
        with AUB crushes, and trying to gather feedback, we decided it was time
        for a change. Our goal is to provide a space where AUB students can
        easily ask, search, and share honest reviews about courses and professors,
        without all the unnecessary hassle.
      </p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of AUB students who’ve been in your shoes. We know how
        challenging it can be to navigate course selections and figure out which
        professors will give you the best experience. That’s why we created this
        website—a platform where students can engage with each other and share
        their real experiences, making it easier for you to assess your academic
        path.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>
      <p>
        This platform is exclusively for AUB students. Only AUB students are
        allowed to review courses and professors, ensuring that every rating and
        piece of feedback is authentic. We believe in creating a healthy and
        positive community, where students can support each other in their
        educational journey. We’re not here to berate or criticize any professors
        or courses but to offer constructive insights. Our website promotes
        respectful language and ensures that offensive or harmful comments are not
        tolerated.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision is to build a platform that helps you make informed decisions
        about your academic path. With a supportive community of real students, we
        want to eliminate the stress and uncertainty of choosing the right courses
        and professors. This website is your first step toward a better university
        experience.
